      <h2>Our Values</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>We believe that by promoting the right mindset, you can achieve more in life, even without a support system. It is important that your desire to grow attain happiness is never determined by another person or a group, but should be driven by yourself and only you.</li>
		  <li>In order to grow, we believe in 3 fundamentals: Money, Muscle, Mindset.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>Money - Money is not everything but everything needs money. Our perception of money's ability to feed happiness is extremely subjective. The pursuit of wealth is not wrong, as it is necessary for living a comfortable life. Unless one is in a comfortable situation, there is no reason to settle for less.</li>
		  <li><p>Muscle - Your physical appearance is an indication of your commitment to staying healthy. The idea is not to always strive for perfection, but to always strive to be better, physically. A good physique is a sign of success. When you look good, you feel good.</p></li>
		  <li><p>Mindset - It is the most important asset one can have if they want to succeed. Mentality plays a big part in steering away from distractions, staying focused striving for greatness. Ultimately, you shape your future by what you think, do, and believe.</p></li>
        </ul>
